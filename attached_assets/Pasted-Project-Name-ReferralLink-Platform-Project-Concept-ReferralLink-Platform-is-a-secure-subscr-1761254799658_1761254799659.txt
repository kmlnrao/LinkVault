Project Name: ReferralLink Platform

Project Concept:

ReferralLink Platform is a secure, subscription-based web portal designed to help users collect, manage, and share referral links for credit cards, bank accounts, subscriptions, and other incentive-based programs. Many institutions offer sign-up bonuses for both the referrer and the new applicant, but users often don’t share links due to privacy concerns or social hesitation. This platform solves that problem by providing a private, secure, and organized environment for sharing and tracking referral links.

Key Features:

Secure Authentication & Privacy:
Google, Microsoft, or email-based authentication ensures a secure login.
All referral links are encrypted and can be shared only with selected groups or contacts.
No public exposure—links are shared only within trusted groups or invited contacts.
Organized Link Management:
Users can categorize referral links (e.g., “Credit Cards,” “Bank Accounts,” “Subscriptions”).
Links include metadata such as bonus value, expiration date, and visibility.
Dashboard for viewing all personal links and shared links within groups.
Private Groups & Contact Sharing:
Create groups of friends or family to share links privately.
Import contacts securely from Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, or Facebook.
Share referral links with specific people or groups instead of public forums.
Subscription & Analytics:
Subscription-based model ensures platform sustainability.
Users can track clicks and usage on their shared links.
Analytics can show which referral links are most effective.
OpenAPI & SDK:
Full OpenAPI spec allows developers to integrate or extend functionality.
TypeScript SDK enables easy integration into frontend or backend workflows.
Robust Infrastructure:
Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive interface.
PostgreSQL database for storing links, users, groups, and sharing data.
Docker + Docker Compose for easy deployment.
Benefits to Subscribers / Users:

Maximize Personal Rewards:
Users don’t miss out on sign-up bonuses because they now have a platform to securely share and manage referral links.
Both referrers and applicants can benefit from rewards without awkwardly asking friends or family.
Privacy & Security:
Keeps referral links private within trusted groups.
Prevents leakage of personal referral codes.
Organized & Efficient:
Users can easily track which links they’ve shared and with whom.
Avoids duplicate submissions or lost referral codes.
Easy Sharing:
Securely invite friends or contacts to access shared links without using insecure channels like email or social media posts.
Benefits to Institutions / Companies Offering Referral Bonuses:

Increased Sign-ups: More people apply using referral links because they are easier to share securely.
Trustworthy Referrals: Sharing within verified groups leads to higher-quality sign-ups.
No Extra Marketing Cost: Users help promote their services through trusted connections.
Tracking: The platform can optionally provide anonymized analytics to institutions about referral trends without exposing personal data.
Value Proposition / Why this Platform is Needed:

Currently, referral programs work but are underutilized because:

People feel shy or uncomfortable sharing links directly.
Referral links get lost in messages, emails, or social media posts.
Users are unaware of potential sign-up bonuses available to them.
ReferralLink Platform solves this by:

Providing a centralized, private hub for all referral links.
Allowing users to share with trust, increasing adoption and reward collection.
Offering analytics and subscription features for engagement and monetization.
Stakeholders & Target Audience:

Primary Users:
Individuals applying for credit cards, bank accounts, subscriptions, or services with referral programs.
People who want to maximize rewards and track referrals securely.
Institutions / Companies:
Banks, fintech companies, subscription services, or any platform offering referral bonuses.
Benefit from more effective and secure referrals without investing in additional marketing.
Developers / Platform Owners:
Gain revenue through subscription fees.
Potentially partner with institutions for featured referral campaigns.
Revenue & Monetization:

Subscription model: Users pay a monthly or annual fee to access premium features (e.g., unlimited links, groups, analytics).
Enterprise integrations: Option to provide anonymized referral analytics or featured referral promotions to institutions.
Affiliate revenue: If allowed, a small percentage from bonuses or promotions could support the platform financially.
